# Fraunhofer IPM SWAP-IT

Holography is a powerful technique that enables the recording and reconstruction of the complete wavefront of light. It has revolutionized the field of metrology by providing a non-intrusive and high-resolution method for measuring various objects. By capturing and analyzing the interference patterns created by the interaction of light waves, holography allows for precise measurements of object shape, size, and surface characteristics. This technology finds applications in fields such as microscopy, 3D imaging, and non-destructive testing.

**Description:** This project consists of two programs:
1. **HoloKeyMapper** is a graphical user interface (GUI) and a program that maps keys from different files together. 
2. **HoloInterface** is a software developed to facilitate the evaluation of the HoloTop Sensor by Fraunhofer IPM customers.
